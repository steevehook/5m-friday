# Is CS degree important?

Question: What's the ultimate purpose of getting a CS degree?

### Pro(s)

- Learn best Theory Fundamentals
- Best research environments (debatable)
- There are kind teachers willing to answer the most stupid question and explain a thing for hours
- Best Math teachers & mentors on Earth

### Con(s)

- Too theoretical, sometimes only theoretical
- Teachers follow a system, predefined program
- They programs are shallow, in a rush, not effective many times
- It's not level based (boring for some, super hard for others)
- Encourages "REMEMBER TILL EXAM" practice
- Everything is super tight, in a rush. Ain't nobody got time for that
- Full of useless crap disciplines => less time for useful disciplines
- They still write code on blackboards
- Little to zero preparation for getting hired in a real company

### Alternatives

- Bootcamp
- Online paid courses / Subscriptions
- YouTube

### University Problems

1) Money
2) Content Quality

### My Personal advices to teachers/universities

- Try to teach practical things (what's on demand)
- Constantly evolve & learn new technologies
- Get feedback from students on what would they want to learn
- Adjust your programs more frequently
- Offer monthly subscriptions to your courses?
- Involve students in your program development
- Redefine learning and passion for learning
- Have direct contracts with Real World companies

### Questions to Answer

1) Do I need a degree to get a job?
2) Will I do a CS degree now?
3) Do I need to be at Math to get the CS degree?
