# 10 secrets in Go

### Intro

- So I was reading a book I bought and ... I found a lot of interesting things, the secrets to the universe.

- Kidding, (close the book), so today we're talking about 10 secrets in Go

- It was a hard for me to choose which one of these secrets / tips & tricks makes it into the list. So if you think others did not make it, let me know in the comments below

1) `nil slice` vs `empty slice`
2) slice three-index
3) type aliases
4) json struct tags
5) anonymous & empty structs
6) go routines run order
7) concurrent safe types
8) shadow everything
9) nil `interface{}`
10) `value` vs `pointer` receiver
